# Sublime CSS Completions
A more complete library of CSS autocompletion for Sublime Text. Instructions for use:

1. Put `css.sublime-completions` anywhere in your Sublime Text Packages folder (look for “Browse Packages...” in ST preferences)
2. Restart Sublime Text
3. [Party!](http://gif.daneden.me/winner.gif)
4. Contribute to this list so that everyone can get better CSS completion.

## Stuff I’m aware of
- Sublime Text already has a lot of CSS autocompletions. There are definitely some duplicates in here.
- Not every property has been explicitly defined. For example, there are no `animation-***` properties—only the root animation property.
- Only properties are autocompleted. Some time in the future, I’d like to have both properties and valid values autocompleted. If anyone knows how to do that, please contribute!
